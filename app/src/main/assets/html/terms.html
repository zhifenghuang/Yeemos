<h2>Change of Terms</h2>

<p>If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending a notification via the app or posting a notice on the Services.

<p>The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by Yeemos on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Yeemos granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Yeemos and its third party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.</p>

In addition, Yeemos may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.

We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. Yeemos cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.  Please take precautions to protect your password and contact us at <a href="mailto:support@yeemos.com">support@yeemos.com</a> if you believe an unauthorized person has accessed your Yeemos account.</p>

Yeemos reserves the right to terminate access to your account, your ability to post to the Services (or use the Services) and refuse, delete or remove any Content; with or without cause and with or without notice, for any reason or no reason, or for any action that Yeemos determines is inappropriate or disruptive to the Services or to any other user of the Services. Yeemos may report to law enforcement authorities any actions that may be illegal, and any reports it receives of such conduct. When legally required or at Yeemos's discretion, Yeemos will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity on the Services or on the Internet.</p>

<h2>Use of Anonymous Feature:</h2>

<p>Sometimes people feel more comfortable sharing true feelings and thoughts without revealing own identities. We understand and respect that it is part of the human natures.  In order for our community to truly express and be emotionally connected, we added the "Anonymous" feature in post settings. However, with great feature comes with great responsibility!  <b>Yeemos HAS ABSOLUTELY ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANY OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT AND/OR ANY ABUSIVE USERS!</b> If any user violates our community guidelines, Yeemos may delete the content and/or accounts without prior notice. Furthermore, Yeemos may inform or assist local law enforcement if further legal action is required.</p>

<h2>Report a Post</h2>

<p>The Yeemos service allows you to follow and view other user's posts. Each user is solely responsible for the content he or she provides and Yeemos is not responsible or liable for any user Content. We do not actively monitor posts and will not censor user Content, except in limited circumstances described in the Yeemos Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.  However, users are allowed to post Content, including potentially inflammatory Content, provided they do not violate the Yeemos Terms of Services and Privacy Policy.  While we are not obligated to do so, we reserve the right, and have absolute discretion, to review, screen and delete user Content at any time and for any reason.</p>

<h2>How do I file a report that someone is posting abusive, objectionable or threatening messages?</h2>

<p>You can file a report that someone is posting abusive, objectionable or threatening vents Content either directly within the application or by emailing your report to <a href="mailto:support@yeemos.com.">support@yeemos.com.</a>.</p>

<h2>What happens when Yeemos receives a valid report?</h2>

<p>Once you have submitted your report, we will review the reported Yeemos account, including any particular posts that have been reported. If the user has violated any of our policies, we will take action, ranging from removing the Content &amp; warning the user up to permanently suspending the user's Yeemos account.</p>

<h2>What do I do if I receive a threat?</h2>

<p>If someone has used Yeemos the Services to threaten or intimidate you, you should report the threat to the police so they can accurately assess the legitimacy of the threat. Yeemos does not have the ability to investigate and assess a threat, bring charges or prosecute individuals. If the police contact Yeemos to investigate a threat, we can work with them and provide the required information for their investigation.</p>

<h2>Mobile and Other Device</h2>

<p>We currently provide our services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, will still apply.</p>

<p>In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number or device, you will update your account information on Yeemos as soon as possible to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number or device.</p>

<p>You agree that any suggestions, feedbacks, ideas or other information or materials regarding Yeemos or the Services that you provide, whether by email or otherwise ("Feedback"), are non-confidential and shall become the sole property of Yeemos.  We will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of such Feedback for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgement or compensation to you.
